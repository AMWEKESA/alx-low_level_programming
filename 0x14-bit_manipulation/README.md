# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This repository contains the solutions to tasks related to bit manipulation in the C programming language. The tasks cover various concepts and operations involving bitwise manipulation of numbers. The goal of this project is to understand how to work with individual bits in order to perform operations efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will be able to:

- Look for the right sources of information without excessive help
- Manipulate bits and utilize bitwise operators effectively

## Tasks

0. **binary_to_uint**: Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1. **print_binary**: Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2. **get_bit**: Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3. **set_bit**: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4. **clear_bit**: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5. **flip_bits**: Write a function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

6. **get_endianness**: Write a function that checks the endianness of the system.

7. **Crackme3**: Find the password for a given program.

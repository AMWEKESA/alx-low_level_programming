# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This repository contains the solutions to tasks related to bit manipulation in the C programming language. The tasks cover various concepts and operations involving bitwise manipulation of numbers. The goal of this project is to understand how to work with individual bits in order to perform operations efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will be able to:

- Look for the right sources of information without excessive help
- Manipulate bits and utilize bitwise operators effectively

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Global variables are not allowed
- Each file should have no more than 5 functions
- Only the C standard library functions malloc, free, and exit are allowed; functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc. are forbidden
- The prototype of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in a header file named `main.h`
- Your header files should have include guards
- Compilation should not include `_putchar.c`
- Quiz questions must be addressed independently to meet the learning objectives

## Tasks

0. **binary_to_uint**: Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1. **print_binary**: Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2. **get_bit**: Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3. **set_bit**: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4. **clear_bit**: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5. **flip_bits**: Write a function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

6. **get_endianness**: Write a function that checks the endianness of the system.

7. **Crackme3**: Find the password for a given program.

**Note:** The `main.c` files are provided as examples and are not required to be pushed to the repository.
